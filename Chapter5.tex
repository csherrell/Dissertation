\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}
There is still a lot I need to get done, but progress is going well.  Currently I am having to interleave this into an already overloaded work schedule.  I am hoping to take some time off to devote to more writing.  I have more done that I have written here, but I just have not had a opportunity to write everything up.

Ideas for future research.
