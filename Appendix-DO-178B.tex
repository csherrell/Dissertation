The software levels as defined by DO-178B are:
\begin{description}
\item[Level A] Software whose anomalous behavior, as shown by the system safety assessment process, would cause or contribute to a failure of system function resulting in a catastrophic failure condition for the aircraft.

\item[Level B] Software whose anomalous behaviors, as shown by the system safety assessment process would cause or contribute to a failure of system function resulting in a hazardous/severe-major failure condition for the aircraft.

\item[Level C] Software whose anomalous behavior, as shown by the system safety assessment process, would cause or contribute to a failure of system function resulting in a major failure condition for the aircraft.

\item[Level D] Software whose anomalous behavior, as shown by the system safety assessment process, would cause or contribute to a failure of system function resulting in a minor failure condition for the aircraft.

\item[Level E] Software whose anomalous behavior, as shown by the system safety assessment process, would cause or contribute to a failure of system function with no effect on aircraft operational capability or pilot workload.
